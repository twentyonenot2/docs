## Time Series Model: Directional Price Volatility Forecasting

A pre-trained model designed to forecast directional volatility trends and expected price range within a defined time period. The model can analyse OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) price data across multiple asset classes, identifying trends from tick-level to long term horizons. 

### Key Features

**Directional Price Forecasts**

- Predicts the price trend for the financial instrument.
- Multiple timeframe analysis will show how prices are changing holistically.

**Risk Forecasts**

- Defines a range for expected price movement during the forecast period
- Can be used to assess and quantify potential market risks.
- Serves as a potential signal for trend changes. If price moves outside this range, it may indicate a shift in the instrument's trend. Such signals can be confirmed by analysing different timeframes.

**Forecast Range**

- Provides a holistic view of price movement from tick level to weeks ahead.

**Position Management**

- Manages trades based on forecasted directions and risk boundaries.


### Training Process
The model was trained using a large dataset of synthetic OHLC price data generated in-house. This approach allows for robust performance across various market conditions and asset classes. By using synthetic data, the model has learnt from a diverse range of market scenarios, enhancing its adaptability and generalisation capabilities.


### Model Architecture
The Time Series Model employs an encoder-decoder inspired architecture, specifically tailored for directional price volatility forecasting:

**1. Encoder**

- Processes the input OHLC price data for an instrument.
- Encodes each OHLC period into a proprietary volatility value.
- This value represents the instrument's periodic directional magnitude.

**2. Long-Term Attention Mechanism**

- Incorporates Markov model probabilities to capture short & long-term dependencies.
- Enables the model to consider historical patterns and transitions over extended periods.

**3. Decoder**

- Utilises the encoded volatility values
- Generates accurate directional trend forecasts for the defined timeframe.

This architecture enables the model to effectively capture the complex patterns in price movements and translate them into low-latency actionable directional forecasts.

## Trading Agent

The Agent was trained to identify and evaluate trading opportunities across global markets. It leverages directional volatility patterns as a primary indicator for potential trades. The Agent can adapt to various market environments without retraining, analysing price movements to detect consistent patterns that may signal profitable trading opportunities.


### Training Process

The Agent has been trained to leverage the directional volatility forecasts and market risk forecasts from the Time Series Model to identify high-probability directional patterns that are in the early phases of trend development, with potential for further progression.

### Key Features

**Search Multiple Price Paths**

The Agent identifies trading opportunities by simultaneously examining multiple price paths. By analysing an instrument's price path from different starting points it can provide a multidimensional view of market dynamics. For example:

- When analysing Tesla's 1-minute price data from September 3, 2024 (9:30 AM) to September 29, 2024, using a 5-day aggregation, the Agent identified 44 trade opportunities.

- By analysing an additional 19 price paths, each starting the day after the previous one, the total number of identified opportunities increased to 187.

This multi-path approach significantly enhances the Agent's ability to identify potential trades.

**Timeframe Aggregation**

The Agent combines short-term price data (like 1-minute intervals) into longer periods (such as 5-minute intervals). This 'aggregation' helps identify consistent volatility patterns across different timeframes, potentially indicating profitable trading opportunities.

**Valid Trade Signal**

A trade opportunity is considered valid under the following conditions:

- There are no existing open trade opportunities.
- Both short-term and long-term volatility exits for any previously identified opportunities have been filled.

**Invalid Trade Signal**

The following criteria should be applied to filter out false signals:

Trade opportunities are disregarded if there are any prevailing open trades.
The following criteria should be applied to filter out false signals:
- The short-term volatility exit is not filled.
- The long-term volatility exit is not filled.

This approach minimises the risk of entering a trade when the price might still be influenced by previous positions, ensuring that only reliable and actionable signals are pursued. 

<Tip>In backtesting, most historic volatility-based exits, both short-term and long-term, would typically be filled. Consequently, valid trades can be identified by ensuring that the trade opportunity date occurs after all previous long-term volatility exit dates.</Tip>

**Optimal Entry Signal**

The earliest buy or sell signal within a series of consecutive signals is regarded as the best entry point, offering the lowest risk for a directional trade. However, subsequent trading opportunities can be pursued at the client's discretion.

**Final Exit Signal**

Trading positions should typically close upon receiving an opposing signal. However, clients may choose to keep positions open at their discretion.
