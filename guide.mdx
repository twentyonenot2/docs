<Tip>All models are trained using synthetic data to ensure that each model will be able to generalise to different asset classes and timeframes.</Tip>

## Time Series Model 

A pre-trained model designed to forecast directional volatility trends and expected price range within a defined period. The model can analyse price data across all asset classes, identifying trends from tick-level to long term horizons. 

### Key Features

**Directional Price Forecasts**

- Predicts the price trend for the financial instrument.
- Multiple timeframe analysis will show how prices are changing over different periods.

**Risk Forecasts**

- Defines a range for expected price movement during the forecast period
- Can be used to assess and quantify potential market risks
- Serves as a potential signal for trend changes. If price moves outside this range, it may indicate a shift in the instrument's trend. Such signals can be confirmed by analysing different timeframes

**Forecast Range**

- Provides a holistic view of price movement from tick level to weeks ahead.

**Position Management**

- Manages trades based on forecasted directions and risk boundaries.

## Trading Agent

The Agent was trained to identify and evaluate trading opportunities across global markets. It leverages directional volatility patterns as a primary indicator for potential trades. The Agent can adapt to various market environments without retraining, analysing price movements to detect consistent patterns that may signal profitable trading opportunities.

### Key Features

**Search Multiple Price Paths**

The Agent identifies trading opportunities by simultaneously examining multiple price paths. By analysing an instrument's price path from different starting points it can provide a multidimensional view of market dynamics. For example:

- When analysing Tesla's 1-minute price data from September 3, 2024 (9:30 AM) to September 29, 2024, using a 5-day aggregation, the Agent identified 44 trade opportunities.

- By analysing an additional 19 price paths, each starting the day after the previous one, the total number of identified opportunities increased to 187.

This multi-path approach significantly enhances the Agent's ability to identify potential trades.

**Timeframe Aggregation**

The Agent combines short-term price data (like 1-minute intervals) into longer periods (such as 5-minute intervals). This 'aggregation' helps identify consistent volatility patterns across different timeframes, potentially indicating profitable trading opportunities.

**Valid Trade Signal**

A trade opportunity is considered valid under the following conditions:

- There are no existing open trade opportunities.
- Both short-term and long-term volatility exits for any previously identified opportunities have been filled.

**Invalid Trade Signal**

The following criteria should be applied to filter out false signals:

Trade opportunities are disregarded if there are any prevailing open trades.
The following criteria should be applied to filter out false signals:
- The short-term volatility exit is not filled.
- The long-term volatility exit is not filled.

This approach minimises the risk of entering a trade when the price might still be influenced by previous positions, ensuring that only reliable and actionable signals are pursued. 

**Optimal Entry Signal**

The earliest buy or sell signal within a series of consecutive signals is regarded as the best entry point, offering the lowest risk for a directional trade. However, subsequent trading opportunities can be pursued at the client's discretion.

**Final Exit Signal**

Trading positions should typically close upon receiving an opposing signal. However, clients may choose to keep positions open at their discretion.
