## Time Series Model: Directional Price Volatility Forecasting

A pre-trained model designed to forecast directional volatility trends and expected price range within a defined time period. The model can analyse OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) price data across multiple asset classes, identifying trends from tick-level to long term horizons. 

### Key Features

**Directional Price Forecasts**

- Predicts the price trend for the financial instrument.
- Multiple timeframe analysis will show how prices are changing holistically.

**Risk Forecasts**

- Defines a range for expected price movement during the forecast period
- Can be used to assess and quantify potential market risks.
- Serves as a potential signal for trend changes. If price moves outside this range, it may indicate a shift in the instrument's trend. Such signals can be confirmed by analysing different timeframes.

**Forecast Range**

- Provides a holistic view of price movement from tick level to weeks ahead.

**Position Management**

- Manages trades based on forecasted directions and risk boundaries.


### Training Process
The model was trained using a large dataset of synthetic OHLC price data generated in-house. This approach allows for robust performance across various market conditions and asset classes. By using synthetic data, the model has learnt from a diverse range of market scenarios, enhancing its adaptability and generalisation capabilities.


### Model Architecture
The Time Series Model employs an encoder-decoder inspired architecture, specifically tailored for directional price volatility forecasting:

**1. Encoder**

- Processes the input OHLC price data.
- Encodes each OHLC period into a single proprietary volatility value.
- This value represents the instrument's periodic directional magnitude.
- This encoding step helps reduce noise and focus on the most relevant price movements.

**2. Long-Term Attention Mechanism**

- Incorporates Markov model probabilities to analyse the likelihood of transitioning from one directional volatility state to another.
- The attention mechanism allows the model to weigh different historical periods differently when making a forecast.
- Through incorporating both short and long-term dependencies, the model can capture both immediate market reactions and longer-term market patterns.

**3. Decoder**

- The decoder uses the encoded volatility values and attention-weighted historical context to produce the final forecast. 
- Generates accurate directional trend forecasts for the defined timeframe.

This architecture enables the model to effectively capture the complex patterns in price movements and translate them into low-latency actionable directional forecasts.

## Trading Agent

The Agent is designed to autonomously navigate global financial markets using directional volatility patterns as its primary indicator to identify and evaluate trading opportunities. The Agent's underlying algorithms enable it to adapt dynamically to diverse market conditions without the need for constant retraining.

### Training Methodology

The Agent's training process is centered on leveraging the directional volatility forecasts and market risk forecasts generated by the Time Series Model. This approach allows the Agent to identify directional patterns that are in the early stages of trend development with high-probability for further development. By focusing on the earlier stages of a trend, the Agent aims to capitalise on market movements before they become widely recognised. 

### Risk Quantification

Each trading opportunity identified by the Agent includes a market risk forecast, which serves two key purposes:

- Downside Risk Quantification: Provides a quantified price range for potential downside risk.
- Position Sizing: Enables position adjustment to maintain consistent risk profiles across trades.

### Applicable Asset Classes 
- Bonds 
- Commodities
- Cryptocurrencies
- Derivatives 
- Equities 
- Exchange Traded Funds
- Indices 
- FX
