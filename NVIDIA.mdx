On November 21st, 2024, NVIDIA's stock experienced extraordinary volatility in the wake of its earnings report, swinging from an all-time high of 152.89 to 140.70 before stabilising.

While the market struggled to interpret NVIDIA's mixed signals - from triple earnings beats to slightly tempered growth guidance - Sumtyme's mathematical abstraction approach cut through the noise. Instead of getting caught up in the fundamental narrative around AI growth rates and quarterly comparisons, our framework focused on the underlying price dynamics.
