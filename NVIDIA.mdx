On November 21st, 2024, NVIDIA's stock experienced extraordinary volatility in the wake of its earnings report, swinging from an all-time high of 152.89 to 140.70 before stabilising.

While the market struggled to interpret NVIDIA's mixed signals - from triple earnings beats to slightly tempered growth guidance - Sumtyme's mathematical abstraction approach cut through the noise. Rather than getting caught up in the fundamental narrative around AI growth rates and quarterly comparisons, our framework focused on the underlying price dynamics.

Our minute-by-minute analysis proved particularly valuable during this volatile session. The model generated accurate signals throughout the wild price swings, capturing both the initial surge to all-time highs and the subsequent reversal. When the stock stabilised in the afternoon, our bullish signals correctly identified the recovery phase.

This performance during NVIDIA's earnings volatility highlights a key advantage of our mathematical framework - the ability to navigate price action driven by competing narratives and complex fundamental factors. While traditional models might have struggled with the apparent contradiction between strong results and cautious guidance, our approach remained focused on the mathematical principles governing price movement, providing clear directional signals throughout the session.
