## Select Time Series Data 

Choose a financial time series for testing, either by:

Using proprietary market data from your organization
Downloading the curated sample dataset we've prepared

### Download sample data from GitHub
import requests
import pandas as pd
import io

def download_github_data(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(response.text))
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to download data: {response.status_code}")

# Example usage
github_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/main/market_data.csv"
market_data = download_github_data(github_url)
print(f"Downloaded {len(market_data)} rows of data")

## ðŸ“ˆ Case Studies

### Trump Tariff Market Shock (April 2025)

The reasoning model provided early warning signals before a major market shock:

| Time Series | Signal Time         | Market Event             | Lead Time |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | --------- |
| 1 minute    | 2025-04-02 10:30:00 | April 2nd 2025 - 4pm EST | 5.5 hours |
| 5 minute    | 2025-04-02 10:30:00 | April 2nd 2025 - 4pm EST | 5.5 hours |
| 15 minute   | 2025-04-02 10:30:00 | April 2nd 2025 - 4pm EST | 5.5 hours |

This real-world example demonstrates how the model can provide valuable advance warning of significant market moves.
