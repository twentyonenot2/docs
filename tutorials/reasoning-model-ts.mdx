### Model Methodology

The reasoning models identify directional trends by predicting how price movements in the selected timeframe are likely to propagate to lower-frequency timeframes, distinguishing structurally significant market moves from noise.

### The Fundamental Problem with Traditional Market Models

Traditional AI approaches to markets fail when facing new conditions, creating a cycle of:

- Training on historical data
- Performing well in similar conditions
- Failing during regime changes
- Requiring retraining
- Repeating the process

These models collapse during critical events like the 1987 crash or 2020 COVID selloff-precisely when prediction matters most.

### Why Pattern Recognition Fails

Traditional models rely on memorisation, not reasoning. They identify historical patterns but can't understand fundamental market dynamics across different conditions.

### From Fragmented to Unified Market Analysis

To overcome these limitations, there is a need for a fundamental shift in how we conceptualise market movements.

#### Traditional View: Independent Timeframes

In the traditional approach, markets are analysed using independent models for different timeframes:

- Short-term models for intraday movements
- Medium-term models for weekly trends
- Long-term models for monthly/yearly outlooks

These models operate in isolation from each other, with no shared understanding of market dynamics.

#### New Paradigm: Unified System Architecture

Our base models analyse markets as an integrated ecosystem where price movements across timeframes are interconnected.

This unified approach reveals three critical insights:

- Price signals flow from high-frequency to low-frequency time series, creating predictable direction patterns.
- Subtle initial price movements serve as early warning indicators, forecasting significant developments in longer timeframes.
- By mapping these cross-timeframe relationships, the models uncover hidden market dynamics that are often missed by conventional single-timeframe models.

### API Implementation Walkthrough

#### Case Study: Systemic market shock

In February-March 2020, global markets experienced one of the fastest and most severe crashes in history as the COVID-19 pandemic spread worldwide. The S&P 500 fell approximately 34% in just 23 trading days, with unprecedented volatility:

•	February 19, 2020: S&P 500 reaches all-time high (3,386)
•	March 23, 2020: S&P 500 bottoms out (2,237)

This case study demonstrates how our reasoning model detected early warning signals across multiple timeframes, [[[[providing several days of advance notice before the crash intensified.]]]]



#### Case Study: Acute market shock

In early April 2025, global markets experienced a sharp, sudden shock as President Trump announced new tariff policies. The market reaction was almost immediate, demonstrating how quickly sentiment can shift in response to policy changes:

•	April 2, 2025: President Trump announces 10% baseline tariff on all imports, with higher tariffs on specific countries including China\
•	April 3, 2025: Nasdaq Composite crashes over 1,050 points (5.97%), marking the largest single-day point loss in its history

This case study demonstrates how our base models deliver real-time directional intelligence, successfully anticipating significant price movements and providing reliable navigation through both extreme volatility and normal trading conditions.

##### Step 3: Run Walk-Forward Test

> This section iterates through data periods sequentially, making API calls at the close of each period to forecast trends for the next interval.

> Plot initial forecast results displaying model predictions across the selected timeframe to provide context and verify reliability.

> Check the API response to see whether a trend has been identified for our future period.

##### Step 4: Quantify Insights

> This section quantifies the reasoning model's effectiveness by measuring lead time — the advance warning period provided before major market movements occur. These measurements demonstrate the practical value of the model's predictive intelligence.


| Time Series | Signal Alignment Timestamp | Lead Time |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| 1 minute     | 2025-04-02 10:30:00  |  30 minutes    |
| 5 minute      | 2025-04-02 10:30:00  |  20 minutes    |
| 15 minute   | 2025-04-02 10:30:00    |    5 minutes   |

> This case study showcases how our unified system architecture detected early signals that provided precise directional intelligence, anticipating the market's intensified selling pressure a full 3 hours before the dramatic decline occurred. The system remained predictive throughout the steep decline, continuing to deliver accurate signals as the market fell.

<Tip>This analysis demonstrates strong baseline performance without any fine-tuning on real-world SPY market data. Predictive accuracy can be significantly enhanced through custom multi-time-horizon fine-tuning or by incorporating proprietary datasets. </Tip>
