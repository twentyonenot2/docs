**Manual Setup**: Use this function `user_signup`to send your sign-up request. It will immediately return your API key and automatically save it to a local `config.txt` file. After signing up, email [team@sumtyme.ai](mailto:team@sumtyme.ai) for account activation.

To get started, you will need to install the sumtyme client library and then use the `user_signup` function to register and receive your API key.

```python
# You can install this package via pip.
pip install sumtyme
```

#### Python Code Example

```python
from sumtyme import EIPClient

# Initialise EIPClient
client = EIPClient(apikey=None)

# Register a new user and get your API key
signup_result = client.user_signup(payload={
    "email": "name@example.com",
    "password": "min_password_length_8",
    "confirm_password":"min_password_length_8"
})
```

After the function runs, your API key will be automatically saved in a new `config.txt` file.

`config.txt` file structure:

```dotenv
apikey="your-api-key-here"
```
