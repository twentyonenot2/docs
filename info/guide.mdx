## Step 1: Choose time intervals to monitor

The Casual Intelligence Layer (CIL) identifies the start of a causal chain by analysing time series data across multiple timeframes, from shortest to longest. First detecting a subtle, initial change at the highest frequency (e.g. milliseconds, seconds). This small directional change then propagates to lower frequencies (minutes, hours, days), leading to a larger, observable directional change.

While we suggest a resolution jump between timeframes of 3-5x the length of the previous timeframe, you can adjust this interval based on your specific needs. For example, a set of timeframes could be:

- 1 minute
- 3 minute
- 15 minute
- 1 hour
- 4 hour

Alternatively, you can choose sequential timeframes for a more granular analysis, such as:

- 1 second
- 2 second
- 3 second
- 4 second

## Step 2: Data Processing

You will need to send time series data for your selected timeframes to the API. Use a window size of 5001 data periods, where the most recent point (the 5001st) is the one you want to forecast. In the below examples, 2025-08-19 at 17:00 is the forecast date.

**Example Data Format for Univariate Time Series**

| #    | datetime            | value |
| ---- | ------------------- | ----- |
| 1    | 2025-01-23 09:00:00 | 100   |
| 2    | 2025-01-23 10:00:00 | 95    |
| ...  | ...                 | ...   |
| 5001 | 2025-08-19 17:00:00 | 0     |

**Example Format for Financial Time Series**

| #    | datetime            | open | high | low | close |
| ---- | ------------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1    | 2025-01-23 09:00:00 | 100   | 110 | 90 | 85 |
| 2    | 2025-01-23 10:00:00 | 95    | 98 | 86 | 88 |
| ...  | ...                 | ...   | ... | ... | ... |
| 5001 | 2025-08-19 17:00:00 | 0     | 0 | 0 | 0 |


## Step 3: Interpreting API outputs

The API's response will include a datetime and a causal chain value for the period you've forecasted. The causal_chain value is an integer indicating the type of chain detected:

- 1: Positive causal chain detected.
- -1: Negative causal chain detected.
- 0: No chain detected.

To identify the current causal chain, you should look for the most recent non-zero value in the output sequence. For instance, if the sequence is [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] with -1 being the most recent value, it signifies that a negative causal chain has been detected.

## Step 4: Tracking Causal Chains Across Timeframes

The CIL provides a roadmap of directional change using progressively lower timeframes, so both short and long term directional changes can be modelled. The following examples demonstrate how an initial directional shift can either fully evolve or fade, depending on its propagation across different timeframes.

### Example: A Fully Evolved Chain

We can demonstrate this principle by using the 1 minute (highest observable frequency), 3 minute, and 15 minute timeframes.

- At 2025-08-19 09:01:00, the 1 minute timeframe shows a +1, initial positive indicator.
- At 2025-08-19 10:03:00, the 3 minute timeframe shows a +1 positive causal chain detected.
- At 2025-08-19 12:15:00, the 15 minute timeframe shows a +1 positive causal chain detected.

This sequence indicates that a positive causal chain has fully evolved across the chosen three timeframes.

### Example: A Fading Causal Chain

A fading causal chain begins to evolve but then loses its momentum before it can fully propagate across all selected timeframes.

The chain begins with a positive indicator:

- At 2025-08-19 09:01:00, the 1 minute timeframe shows a +1, initial positive indicator.
- At 2025-08-19 10:03:00, the 3 minute timeframe shows a +1, positive causal chain detected.
- At 2025-08-19 11:21:00, before the change can fully evolve to the 15 minute timeframe, the 3 minute timeframe shows a -1, negative causal chain detected.

This opposing signal indicates that the initial directional shift didn't maintain its strength, causing the chain to fade rather than continue to build.

## Tracking Causal Chains: A Visual Guide to Market Dynamics

By tracking causal chains from short timeframes to longer ones, we can illustrate how significant directional changes unfold in complex systems by observing casual structure.

### Tracking a Positive Directional Change

This example demonstrates how the CIL autonomously identified a [fully evolved positive causal chain in BTCUSDT](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cfxxB/15/) with no training data or fine-tuning. The initial indicator was identified on the 1 second timeframe and propagated across multiple timeframes, leading to a significant price increase from $75,000 to over $100,000 between April and May 2025.

### Identifying and Navigating Temporary Market Reversals

The CIL can autonomously understands and navigates market dynamics. During a [temporary price reversal in BTCUSDT](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5cPh1/6/), the CIL identified a short-term directional change before successfully realigning with the larger, underlying positive chain. This ability to distinguish between minor fluctuations and significant directional changes showcases the CIL's unique insight into both micro and macro-level system dynamics.
