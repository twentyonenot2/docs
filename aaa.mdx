This is a Python interface for interacting with the **Embedded Intelligence Platform (EIP)** by [sumtyme.ai](http://sumtyme.ai). The EIP uses a proprietary AI architecture called **Abstract Generalised Networks (AGNs)** to model how complex systems evolve.

Unlike traditional machine learning, AGNs do not require training, fine-tuning, or retraining. Instead, they autonomously rewrite their underlying algorithms as they observe new data, allowing them to holistically understand how directional shifts influence a system. This approach is ideal for analyzing dynamic domains like financial markets and weather patterns, focusing on the **structure of change** rather than just predicting the next step.
