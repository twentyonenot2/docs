The sumtyme-eip-client provides a Python interface to sumtyme.ai's Embedded Intelligence Platform (EIP). This platform utilises Abstract Generalised Networks (AGNs) to model the evolution of dynamic systems, such as financial markets and weather patterns, through their directional changes.

AGNs analyse and adapt to system dynamics in real-time. They operate without requiring traditional training data, fine-tuning, or retraining after deployment. The focus is on understanding the structure of change through understanding how information propagates through time, rather than predicting the next step.


## Key Features 

- Abstract Generalised Networks (AGNs): leverage a proprietary AI architecture that autonomously adjust its algorithms based on observed data.
- System Evolution Modelling: Models underlying structural changes and directional shifts within a system.
- Python
