## Create an account and learn how to model with sumtyme.ai.

[Create your sumtyme account](https://www.sumtyme.ai/signup) to begin modelling complex multiscale systems, from shifting financial markets to evolving climate patterns in minutes.

Once you've got your API key, follow our **Walkthrough Guide** to analyse your first multiscale system and learn our modelling principles.


Why us?
- Deterministic Insights: map the specific causal trajectory of change from its point of inception rather than a probabilistic distribution. 
- Zero Information Loss: track the signal's propagation through multiple time scales in real-time with no smoothing or data loss common in statistical modelling.
- Continual Learning: allow the CIL to use its understanding of how causal structures evolve to remain accurate in transition states where no historical data exists. 


### Common CIL Use Cases

#### Finance

- Identify change at its point of inception and track its evolving impact in real time.
