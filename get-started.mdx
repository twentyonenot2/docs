## Create an account and learn how to model with sumtyme.ai.

[Create your sumtyme account](https://www.sumtyme.ai/signup) to begin modelling complex multiscale systems, from shifting financial markets to evolving climate patterns in minutes.

Once you've got your API key, follow our [**walkthrough guide**](https://www.sumtyme.ai/signup) to analyse your first multiscale system and learn our modelling principles.

### Why us?

- Deterministic Insights: map the specific causal trajectory of change from its point of inception rather than a probabilistic distribution.
- Zero Information Loss: track the signal's propagation through multiple time scales in real-time with no smoothing or data loss common in statistical modelling.
- Continual Learning: allow the CIL to use its understanding of how causal structures evolve to remain accurate in transition states where no historical data exists.
