**What is Genesis’ underlying model architecture?**

While Genesis is proprietary, its underlying architecture consists of two primary models. The first is a mathematical model that calculates directional volatility based on open, high, low, and close prices, resulting in a proprietary volatility dataset. The second model is a transition probability model that utilises this volatility dataset to model the time-varying probabilities between different volatility states.

**What data was used to train the model?** 

The model was trained using proprietary volatility data derived from the S&P 500 daily price data from 2000 to 2021. To enhance the model's robustness, additional synthetic volatility data generated in-house was used for further training.

**What is the minimum time periods Genesis needs to start forecasting?**

Genesis requires a minimum of 100 complete OHLC time periods to start forecasting, however we recommend at least 400 complete OHLC time periods to allow Genesis to understand the context of the underlying time series. 

**What asset classes can Genesis be applied to?**

- Bonds 
- Commodities
- Cryptocurrencies 
- Derivatives
- Equities
- Indices 
- FX 

**What are Genesis’ data inputs?** 

- Datetime (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.f)
- Open Price (Float)
- High Price (Float)
- Low Price (Float)
- Close Price (Float)

**What are Genesis’ outputs?**

- Price trend forecast: 1 = bullish, -1 = bearish or 0 = stable.  
- Price trend forecast plot: cumulative value of the price trend forecast. 
- Risk Forecast: higher/ lower price boundary.
- Risk Forecast (%): Lower price boundary represented as a percentage from open price.

**Can Genesis quantify the risk associated with each forecast?**

Genesis provides an associated risk forecast with each price trend forecast. The risk forecast represents the expected range the price will stay within for the forecasted period. If price moves outside the price boundary, it signals a potential change in price trend that can be confirmed by analysing a shorter time horizon.

**Can Genesis handle multiple time series?** 

Genesis can currently only hand univariate time series. 

**Can Genesis forecast multiple steps ahead?**

Genesis can currently only forecast one-step ahead.

**Can Genesis handle irregular time stamps?**

Genesis can handle financial time series with irregular timestamps (format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.f).

**Does Genesis have any underlying model assumptions?**

Yes, Genesis assumes that an instrument's price is solely influenced by the buying and selling activity of market participants.

**Why are Genesis' risk forecasts slightly different for the same underlying time series?**

Genesis uses Monte Carlo style simulations to generate numerous possible price paths for the underlying time series. Due to the inherent randomness in these simulations, the risk forecasts can vary slightly each time. However, these variations should generally fall within a specific percentage range.

**Is Genesis open source?** 

Genesis is currently closed source.
