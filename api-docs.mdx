A Python interface for interacting with the Embedded Intelligence Platform (EIP). The EIP uses a proprietary AI architecture called Abstract Generalised Networks (AGNs) to model how complex systems evolve.

Unlike traditional machine learning, AGNs do not require training data, fine-tuning, or retraining. Instead, they autonomously rewrite their underlying algorithms as they observe new data, allowing them to holistically understand how directional shifts influence a system. This approach is ideal for analysing dynamic domains like financial markets and weather patterns, focusing on the structure of change rather than just predicting the next step.

### Python Package

To install the `sumtyme` Python package, you'll use `pip`, Python's standard package manager. Just run the following command in your terminal:

```powershell
pip install sumtyme
```

### Explainers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AGNs vs. Traditional  Architectures">
    Traditional AI architectures often struggle to model complex, dynamic systems because they're limited to predicting the next step in a sequence using fixed, linear patterns.

    Abstract Generalised Networks (AGNs) use category theory to model the underlying structure of a time series. This provides a holistic view, enabling them to understand the complex forces that drive changes in a system.

    AGNs are not autoregressive and analyse the entire data window simultaneously. Therefore, any outputs observed before the last data period of a window should be used for context and not as a prediction. The recommended window size is 5001 data periods.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Information Propagation ">
    Abstract Generalised Networks (AGNs) model a system's evolution by observing how information propagates across timeframes. This process begins when a directional change on a shorter timeframe creates an early indicator. As the move develops, this indicator propagates to longer timeframes, reinforcing the initial indicator much like a relay system. This propagation continues until the move is fully developed and the indicator dissipates, providing a deeper understanding of a system's evolution that moves beyond simple next-step prediction.
