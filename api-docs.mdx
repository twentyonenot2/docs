A Python interface for interacting with the Embedded Intelligence Platform (EIP). The EIP uses a proprietary AI architecture called Abstract Generalised Networks (AGNs) to model how complex systems evolve.

Unlike traditional machine learning, AGNs do not require training data, fine-tuning, or retraining. Instead, they autonomously rewrite their underlying algorithms as they observe new data, allowing them to holistically understand how directional shifts influence a system. This approach is ideal for analysing dynamic domains like financial markets and weather patterns, focusing on the structure of change rather than just predicting the next step.

### Python Package

To install the `sumtyme` Python package, you'll use `pip`, Python's standard package manager. Just run the following command in your terminal:

```powershell
pip install sumtyme
```

### Explainers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="AGNs vs. Traditional  Architectures">
    Traditional AI architectures often struggle to model complex, dynamic systems because they're limited to predicting the next step in a sequence using fixed, linear patterns.

  Abstract Generalised Networks (AGNs) use category theory to model the underlying structure of a time series. This provides a holistic view, enabling them to understand the complex forces that drive changes in a system.

    AGNs are not autoregressive and analyse the entire data window simultaneously. Therefore, any outputs observed before the last data period of a window should be used for context and not as a prediction. The recommended window size is 5001 data periods.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Information Propagation ">
    Abstract Generalised Networks (AGNs) operate on the theory of information propagation across timeframes. When a directional change is identified on a shorter timeframe, it creates an early indicator. As this move evolves, that indicator propagates to longer timeframes reinforcing the earlier indicator. This propagation continues until the move is fully developed and the indicator dissipates. This provides a deeper understanding of a system's evolution that moves beyond a simple next-step prediction.

### Demonstrations

<Accordion title="SPY ETF - Early 2020">
  The SPY ETF saw a significant decline from mid-February to March as investors reacted to the spread of COVID-19 and the potential for a global economic shutdown.
  
  By analysing the SPY's mathematical structure using AGNs, an initial negative indicator was identified in late January. This indicator first appeared on the 5-minute time series and then propagated to progressively longer timeframes, reaching the 160-minute time series in this example.

  With no fine-tuning or retraining, AGNs are able to identify directional changes at different time resolutions providing a holistic understanding of directional change across an entire system.
