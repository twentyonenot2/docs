Our Embedded Intelligence Platform (EIP) leverages proprietary learning algorithms to model cause and effect in complex systems. We believe that understanding a system's behaviour requires more than just modelling the relationships between variables. Instead, our technology observes the system directly through its time series data, modelling its causal evolution from an initial state shift to a resulting directional change.

Imagine a complex system as a still pond. A pebble's impact is the cause, creating a ripple that expands into waves, representing the effect. By observing the pond's time series data for turbulence, our algorithms can identify the initial shift and trace its progression without needing external context about who threw the pebble or where it was thrown from.

This approach allows today's model building to go beyond simple correlation and truly understand the underlying behaviour of complex systems. Our autonomous and parameter-free algorithms require no training data or continuous retraining, making our technology robust and ready for real-world applications across different industries, from finance and weather to biology and beyond.

### Python Package

To install the `sumtyme` Python package, you'll use `pip`, Python's standard package manager. Just run the following command in your terminal:

```powershell
pip install sumtyme
```
