## Sumtyme.ai

We are a machine learning startup focused on building foundation models for the financial markets. Our proprietary machine learning algorithms are designed to understand the complex context and drivers behind price movements, allowing us to effectively model short and long-term volatility shifts across global markets. 


## Mission

Our mission is to provide clients with a real-time, contextualised view into how financial markets are evolving. We provide predictive insights that allows traders, investors, and institutions to make more informed decisions and stay ahead of market trends. 

## Genesis

Our first model, Genesis is a pre-trained time series model for financial time series forecasting specifically trained for the financial markets. Genesis is trained on proprietary directional price volatility data, allowing it to remain predictive during times of extreme market volatility. 


## Benefits

**Leverage zero-shot forecasting:** Genesis is asset class agnostic and can be used to forecast trends for tick-level data to several weeks ahead without costly retraining.

**Improve decision-making:** A holistic view of price dynamics across various time frames allows for more informed decision-making. Short-term forecasts can guide tactical positioning, while medium- and long-term forecasts can inform strategic asset allocation and investment decisions.

**Enhance risk management:** Incorporating multiple time horizon forecasts can aid in risk management by identifying potential sources of risk and providing a more robust understanding of the risk-reward trade-offs at different time horizons.

**Capture different price drivers:** Different factors influence price movements at various time scales. High-frequency forecasts can capture the impact of supply-demand imbalances, news or sentiment factors while low-frequency forecasts can reflect the effects of macroeconomic conditions. 

**Identify trend changes:** By combining forecasts across different time horizons, you can more effectively identify potential trend changes or inflection points.

**Faster Training:** Since Genesis has already learned the underlying trend of the time series, the training process for fine-tuning the model for a specific instrument is significantly faster than training a predictive model from scratch.
