Sumtyme.ai uses machine learning to deliver general-purpose algorithms specifically trained for global financial markets.

These models are asset class agnostic and can analyze high to low frequency time series data. Each model is trained to identify directional volatility patterns which remain consistent regardless of market conditions.

This adaptive approach ensures consistent performance as markets evolve in comparison to traditional price pattern recognition approaches.
