title: "CIL Quickstart"
---

This quickstart guide enables you to model complex multiscale systems, such as financial markets, with no reliance on training data.

The CIL models directional changes as a continuous causal chain, eliminating the need for historical datasets and providing a deterministic view of system evolution.

In this guide you will learn:

- **Identification:** How to pinpoint system changes at their exact point of inception within the microscale.
- **Tracking:** How to follow an initial causal signal's evolution across multiple scales with zero information loss.
- **Detection:** How to identify the closure of a causal chain, signifying the end of a directional evolution.

## Prerequisites

#### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

We recommend using a virtual environment to prevent dependency conflicts with other projects.

On Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On Windows:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 2. Install the Package

Once your environment is active, install the core library required for causal chain modelling.

```bash
pip install sumtyme
```

<Note>
   The sumtyme package provides the underlying engine for detecting directional changes and analysing multiscale systems without requiring external training datasets.
</Note>

#### 3. Verify Installation

You can quickly verify that the package is ready for use by checking the version in your terminal:

```bash
  python -c "import sumtyme; print(sumtyme.__version__)"
```
