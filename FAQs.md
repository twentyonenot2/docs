## About

Sumtyme.ai is developing foundation models for financial time series forecasting. We are building machine learning models that understand the context driving price fluctuations and effectively model long-term volatility shifts.

Our first model, Genesis is a pre-trained time series model for financial time series forecasting specifically trained for the financial markets. 

## Benefits


•	Improve decision-making: A holistic view of price dynamics across various time frames allows for more informed decision-making. Short-term forecasts can guide tactical positioning, while medium- and long-term forecasts can inform strategic asset allocation and investment decisions.

•	Enhance risk management: Incorporating multiple time horizon forecasts can aid in risk management by identifying potential sources of risk and providing a more robust understanding of the risk-reward trade-offs at different time scales.

•	Capture different price drivers: Different factors influence price movements at various time scales. High-frequency forecasts can capture the impact of supply-demand imbalances, news and sentiment while low-frequency forecasts can reflect the effects of macroeconomic conditions. 

•	Balanced perspective of price movement: Through incorporating multiple time horizon forecasts a more balanced perspective can be gained in comparison to a single, potentially biased time frame. 

•	Identify trend changes: By combining forecasts across different time horizons, you can more effectively identify potential trend changes or inflection points.
