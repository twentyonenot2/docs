title: 'The Infrastructure Layer for Market Intelligence'
---

Real-time market direction prediction remains challenging, compromising both trading decisions and risk management. Training models on historical data inherently constrains their predictive power. Markets evolve beyond past patterns, exposing fundamental flaws in even the most advanced predictive systems.

### Core Technology

A time series foundation model purpose-built for financial markets that generalises across any time interval, market or asset class without requiring pre-training, eliminating the need to build market-specific models from scratch.


### Multi-Timeframe Intelligence

Through fine-tuning across multiple time horizons, users gain insight into how trends develop and evolve across different market periods. By incorporating proprietary data, users can enhance these insights with their own market intelligence.

User Benefits:

* **Researchers**: Accelerate research by fine-tuning with proprietary data rather than building model architectures from scratch.

* **Risk Managers**: Build real-time risk systems that detect and respond to emerging market shifts, moving beyond static range forecasts.

* **Investment Firms**: Scale trading strategies across markets without specialised hiring for each domain, reducing expertise costs.

* **Fintechs**: Build and launch market applications at speed, leveraging our model like companies built on large language models.

### The Future of Market Analytics

Just as cloud computing transformed software deployment, our foundation model represents a fundamental shift in market analysis - serving as the infrastructure layer that powers the next generation of trading strategies, risk systems and financial applications.
