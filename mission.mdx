title: 'The Infrastructure Layer for Market Intelligence'
---

Traditional market forecasting has long been constrained by range-based predictions – a “likely” price range that often proves too broad to be actionable. We're fundamentally different - providing real-time directional analytics that dynamically adapt to market changes.

### Core Technology

A time series foundation model purpose-built for financial markets that generalises across any time interval, market or asset class without requiring pre-training, eliminating the need to build market-specific models from scratch.

### Multi-Timeframe Intelligence

Through fine-tuning across multiple time horizons, users gain insight into how trends develop and evolve across different market periods. By incorporating proprietary data, users can enhance these insights with their own market intelligence.

Using our model as a base layer enables:

* **Researchers**: Focus on fine-tuning with proprietary data instead of building separate models, speeding up the research pipeline.

* **Risk Managers**: Create real-time risk monitoring systems that respond faster to changing market conditions, moving beyond static range-based forecasts.

* **Investment Firms**: Enable existing staff to develop trading strategies across multiple markets without deep expertise in each area.

* **Fintechs**: Rapidly prototype and launch new financial applications across market segments, similar to how companies leveraged language models to create diverse AI applications.

### The Future of Market Analytics

Just as cloud computing transformed software deployment, our foundation model represents a fundamental shift in market analysis - serving as the infrastructure layer that powers the next generation of trading strategies, risk systems and financial applications.
